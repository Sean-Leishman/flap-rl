# FLAPPY BIRD RL
Implmentation of the Flappy Bird game but rather than relying on user control the NEAT algorithm has been implemented which is an evolutionary algorithm based on evolving neural network brains. Various features of the game can be adjusted such as speed and jump height in order to test the generalizability of the model.
